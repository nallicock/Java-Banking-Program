This project was designed with the intentions of utilizing most OOP concepts. 
There will be a GUI implemented with this, as well as more OOP concepts as I develop this application more.
I would also like to link this to a database with a login and password to save user data.
There is the Account class which has two inner classes: Chequings and Savings. 
Savings also has a child class (inheritance) named InterestSavings.
This project uses Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Classes, loops, methods, Overriding, Constructors
Next steps: Develop GUI, Implement try/catch, method overloading, linking a database, and possibly arrays.
